My Speck Code Reconstruction

###TODO List
- [x]  Speck & Simon
- [x]  Generate Data
- [x]  Network Construction
- [ ]  Network Training

### Notes
Found lots of weird choice in the process of network construction. Need to test more!
More specifically, why gohr use all same filter_num?

Why Gohr use cyclic lr only with decreasing part?
